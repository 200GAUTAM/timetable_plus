Timetable ++

This timetable software is developed in java Swing.  
I have created this application to help my college staffs easily create timetable.  

This timetable generator program will work even if the timetable is partially filled manually.  
Genetic algorithm(Selection and Mutation) is used in this timetable generator program.
